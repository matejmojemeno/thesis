# Video Recording Based Sperm Cell Movement Prediction and Modes of movement Detection

This thesis explores the use of machine learning techniques to predict the
future path of sperm cells, classify their directional orientation, and predict
their rotation from video data. The research is motivated by the need to better
understand the behavior and motility of sperm cells, which play a crucial role
in biomedical research and human reproduction studies.
